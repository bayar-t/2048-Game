1)To replace every "fun" with "amazing" you type ":%s/fun/amazing/g" and press
enter. To only replace the first instace, you type ":%s/fun/amazing/" and press
enter.

2)To create a new direction call fooDir and inside this create another directory
called barDir, you would type "mkdir -p fooDir/barDir" and press enter.

3)javac *.java - 
this compiles all the files in the current directory.

4)Type "gvim *.java" and press enter in cmd.

5)Static methods do not require a calling object. Instead you use their class to
call them.
Ex: Math.abs(integer x).
This calls abs on the Math class using an integer parameter and returns the
absolute value of the integer parameter.

6)She can improve her design by generalizing her shape methods by using a color
parameter to define what color it is. So intead of using drawRedCircle(), she
should use a drawCircle(Color color) to make it so that there is a Color
parameter. So by doing this, she will only need one method for every color of a
shape.
